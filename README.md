Demo to show how to quickly create a CRUD - Blog app - in Django, using Class Based Generic Views.  
-- Using materialize for styling.

Based on tutorials:  
	- https://scotch.io/@CleverProgrammer/how-to-make-a-django-blog-app  	
    - https://www.techiediaries.com/django-crud-generic-views/  


TODO's:
- Once this is just a proof of concept, several things were left out:  
-- Using a proper database engine, instead of 'sqlite'.  
-- Creating proper separated environment configs to DEV and deploy, in order to protect access credentials and project SECRET_KEY.
